* Disorganiser

A task management plug-in for Vim, heavily "inspired by" emacs org-mode and vim-orgmode (though not sharing any code with those projects).

Probably contains 1% of the functionality of vim-orgmode; on the other hand, runs at full speed even when your org file is larger than a few kilobytes.

Requires a recent Vim with Python 3 support.

In insert mode:

  | <S-CR>| Insert heading below current (same as S-CR in normal mode)|

When editing tables, in normal mode:

  | <TAB>| Reformat table and move to next cell, or next row (if at end), creating a new row if needed|
  | <CR> | Reformat table and move to first cell of next row, creating a new row if needed            |
